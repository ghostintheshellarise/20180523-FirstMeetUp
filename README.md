# Introduction

This repository stores three files used for the demo. in the presentation "Scientific computing using Python and R: a thermal and building science researcher's perspective". They are

* _Demo.ipynb_: Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of Python
* _Demo-R.ipynb_: Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of R
* _Demo.xlsx_: Data used by both notebooks for the demo.

In order to run _Demo.ipynb_ properly, you'll need Python 3.5 or higher and modules _pandas_, _matplotlib_, _scikit-learn_, _jupyter_ and their prerequiste modules. You are advised to download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to simplify the procedure.

To run _Demo-R.ipynb_, besides _Python 3.5 or higher_ and the module _jupyter_, you will also need

* R 3.2 or higher with instructions [here](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel)
* R library _ggplot2_ with instructions [here](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
* R library _readxl_ with instructions [here](http://readxl.tidyverse.org/)

Then, all you need is type

```
jupyter notebook
```

in the directory where you stored the files. Click at the _.ipynb_ file and you'll be able to see the _jupyter_ notebooks!
